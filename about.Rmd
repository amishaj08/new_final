## About the Project
**Title:** Karate Statistics around the World

**Description:** My project, *Karate Statistics around the World*, has graphs that give extra information about karate that is going on in the US and other countries. The first graph analyzes the different genders that instruct karate at their studio. The second graph has data about the most medals won by different countries during the 2021 World Karate Championships U21.

**Data Sources:** I used two websites for the graphs. They had tables of information which I was able to use.
One is [Zippia: The Career Expert](https://www.zippia.com/martial-arts-instructor-jobs/demographics/) and the other is [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cadet,_Junior_and_U21_Karate_Championships). 


*I learned how to create this project from David Kane's Bootcamp!*
